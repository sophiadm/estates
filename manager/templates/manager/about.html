    <h1>Why rent from us</h1>

and believe that as they are paying us rent every month they are also entitled to a good service, whenever they have a problem with their 
accommodation they need us to take care of. We pride orselves in the support delivered to clients, something which the company is
always striving to improve. Clients employ our services as they look to find their feet in a
new city and environment, as they move across neighbourhoods to be closer to work or that
all important station, our high level of customer satisfaction from our service and customer care
is reflected in the low turn-over of our client tenants as most people who rent a property from us stay with us for many years,
as they appreciate the fact that we keep their home in good condition and quickly attend to any problems</p>
